# Site Maintenance

Creating a maintenance schedule to prevent site degration. Consider implementing tasks such as:

* **Daily:** 5-minute checks to verify uptime and catch pressing issues
* **Weekly:** 30-minute sessions to perform updates and/or backups while reviewing site metrics
* **Monthly:** time blocks to review performance, optimization, security, and content relevance
* **Annually:** evaluate design or content trends, update visual elements, and ensure alignment with goals
