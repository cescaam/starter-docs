# General Settings

The General Settings page lets you modify key components of your site such as your:

* **Site Title:** what users will know your site by
* **Tagline:** providing additional context for your users
* **Site Icon:** what users see in their browser tabs, bookmark bars, and on mobile apps
* **Timezone:** providing geographic context for your content

Ensuring these settings are completed increases your site's visual consistency and brand identity, but can also improve your site's performance, reach, and impact on users.
