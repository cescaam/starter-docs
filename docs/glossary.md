# Glossary

### Address
An address (or “web address”) is the reference for a specific resource on the World Wide Web, such as a website. This is also known as a URL (short for Uniform Resource Locator).

### Automattic
Automattic is the company that owns and creates WordPress.com, as well as several other web platforms and services.

### Block
A block is a distinct structural element on a page, post, or widget area. In the WordPress Editor, blocks allow you to add and edit specific content areas, such as text, images, and videos.

### Browser
A browser (or web browser) is a software application on your computer, tablet, phone, or other device used to view and interact with sites on the World Wide Web. Common browsers include Chrome, Edge, Firefox, and Safari.

### Cache
A cache is a stored record of information. We commonly refer to a browser cache, where your browser temporarily stores the information of sites you’ve visited recently. This can also refer to the site cache, where data about your site is stored on our servers to deliver it more quickly the next time it is requested.

### Content
Content is anything published on your site: text, images, videos, audio files, and any other information you make available to people.

### Dashboard
The dashboard is the main control panel area for your WordPress.com site. There are two versions of the site dashboard: the standard WordPress.com dashboard, which you can access at wordpress.com/home, and the “classic” WP Admin dashboard.

### Domain name
A domain name (or simply “domain”) is an address people use to visit your site.

### Domain connection
Domain connection is the association of a specific address to your site so that when a domain is connected to your site, typing that address into a web browser will load your site.

### Domain registration
Domain registration is the lease of a specific address by an individual or an entity. This address is generally connected to a specific site. For example, when you register a domain through WordPress.com, the domain is associated with your WordPress.com account.

### Dropdown menu
A drop-down menu, or sub-menu, shows additional items when you hover or click on an item in your menu.

### Editor
The editor is the interface that enables you to edit the content on your site, such as pages and posts. WordPress.com has two editors: the WordPress Editor (Block Editor), and the Classic Editor.

### Footer
The footer displays content in widget areas at the bottom of your site, below the main content of every page or post. For example, you can use the footer to share your contact information and social media links, provide a site menu, or any other information you want to make available throughout your site.

### Site Editing
Site Editing is a collection of interrelated features which enables you to edit your entire site using blocks, taking advantage of the familiar and flexible experience of the Block Editor.

### Header
The header displays content at the top of your site, above the main content of every page or post. Your site’s title, tagline, and navigation menus are commonly found in the header.

### Homepage
A home page (also called a homepage or a front page) is the first page visitors will see when they visit your site.

### Jetpack
Jetpack is a plugin built into plugin-enabled WordPress.com sites. Jetpack on WordPress.com includes site activity records and backups, optimized performance, anti-spam features, security and downtime monitoring, and much more. Learn about Jetpack on WordPress.com.

### Landing page
A landing page is a standalone page generally used for a single purpose (sometimes called a “call to action”), such as encouraging your visitors to sign up for a service, buy a product, or join a mailing list. You can use WordPress.com to create a landing page by creating a one-page website with a static front page or creating a single page within your larger site.

### Legacy
A legacy feature is a feature that has been retired from development. You may still have access to legacy features on your site, but they are no longer being improved upon and may not work well with newer versions of WordPress. See also legacy plans.

### Menu
A menu is a list of links for accessing your site’s content, typically displayed at the top of your site.

A page is a static document for displaying content on your site. For example, some common pages on a site include the Home, About, and Contact pages.

A plan is a packaged set of options that allow you to add functionality, storage space, and other features to your WordPress.com site. You can learn about the WordPress.com plans here.

### Plugin
A plugin is a piece of software used to add extra features to WordPress. Some plugins like WooCommerce, are made and updated by Automattic. Other plugins are created by people and companies in the WordPress community. These are sometimes called third-party plugins and are supported by their developers.

### Plugin-enabled
A plugin-enabled site is a site that has activated the full hosting features available on WordPress.com Business and Commerce plans or the legacy Pro plan. Most commonly, this happens when you install your first plugin, but your site can also be considered plugin-enabled after uploading a third-party theme, activating backups, or activating hosting features at Settings → Server settings.

### Post
A post is a document for displaying dynamic content on your site, generally listed in reverse chronological order. Posts are always associated with a date, which is included in the URL.

### SEO
SEO (short for “search engine optimization”) is the process of improving your site to help it rank high in the results of search engines such as Google and Bing.

### Subscription
When talking about WordPress.com upgrades and other products, a subscription is the dated period of the upgrade plan for your site.

When talking about your blog itself, subscription refers to site visitors signing up to receive email updates whenever you publish a new post.

### Third-party
Third-party refers to products, such as plugins and themes, which aren’t made or developed by WordPress.com. You can acquire these products from WordPress.org’s plugin and theme repositories, the developer’s website, or a third-party marketplace. Because we don’t make these products, our scope of support for them is limited.
