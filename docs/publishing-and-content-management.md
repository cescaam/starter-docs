# Publishing & Content Management

Professional navigation follows established conventions with 5-7 clearly labeled main menu items. Users should find any information within three
clicks using intuitive pathways. Sites require the following pages as a minimum:
• Homepage
• About
• Services or products
• Contact
• Privacy policy or terms

In WordPress, you can put content on your site as either a Post or a Page.

## Posts
When you’re writing a regular blog entry, you write a Post. Posts, in a default setup, appear in reverse chronological order on your blog’s home page.

WordPress posts can have several statuses. The status of a post determines how WordPress handles the post. For example, public posts can be seen by everyone if they have the publish status. WordPress has 8 statuses ready for users.

* Publish

* Draft
* Pending
* Private
* Trash
* Auto-Draft
* Inherit

### Categories
Every post is placed under a category in WordPress. This improves navigation and allows for post organization. Posts under the same category can be grouped together with ease.

### Tags
Every post can also be placed under a tag. The latest build of WordPress displays tags under each post. When someone is looking at your post and clicks the tag link, an archive page with all those posts with the same tag will appear. 

## Pages
You can use Pages to organize and manage the structure of your website content. You can add as many pages to your site as you would like, and you can update your pages as many times as you want.
After you create a page, you can add it to your site’s navigation menu so your visitors can find it.

In contrast, Pages are for non-chronological content. Pages live outside of the normal blog chronology and are often used to present timeless information about yourself or your site – information that is always relevant.

## Media
Media can be an image, video, audio recording, or compatible files that you upload and use in your site. 

Visit the Media add new screen to upload new media by clicking Add New.
> NOTE: Some media formats may not be supported.
## Revisions

Records each saved draft or published update. The revision system lets you see what changes were made in each iteration.

It will display what was changed, added, removed, or unmodified. It includes any line and character changes. You can click the Restore This Revision button to undo a change.

There is also a comparison tool for revisions that allows you to see the difference between two iterations.

To return to the post edit screen without restoring a revision, click on the post title at the top of the page.

## Visibility
You can control what is visible on your site. WordPress lets you control the visibility of your posts and web pages individually, but everything is visible on your site by default.

### Site
You can set the visibility of your content in several ways. You can set it on a per post or page basis or make the entire site private and password protected.

### Page and posts
You can change the visibility of your posts and pages from the Edit screen. The option is seen under the Publish option in the top-right corner of the screen.
