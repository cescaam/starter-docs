# Choose the right theme

The selected theme decides how your site appears to users, and by default your WordPress site theme is polished and simple. You can customize this theme through colours, fonts, content format, and media.

WordPress offers a large catalog of themes for you to choose from if you want a different site design. Using a theme that supplements your content makes it easier for readers to take in your content.

For example, if your site mostly has text based content then a theme with contrasting but complementary colours and font makes a huge difference with your readers.

> NOTE: Some themes will only be available with an active subscription.

## Change your theme
To change your theme at any time and however you like:
1. Hover over the **Appearance** menu item on the left side of the screen from the **My Home** page
2. Wait for the rest of the **Appearance** menu items to appear on the right
3. Click **Themes**
4. Explore and filter through the themes
5. Click the theme you want
6. Click **Activate**

WordPress will notify you on the top right corner of the screen if the theme is successfully installed. 

## Modify your theme
To make changes to your current theme:
1. Hover over the **Appearance** menu item on the left side of the screen from the **My Home** page
2. Wait for the rest of the **Appearance** menu items to appear on the right
3. Click **Editor**

This will bring you to the **Block Editor** where you can make changes to the appearance of your site like its styles, pages, templates, and patterns.

The **Block Editor** is the default content creation and modification tool in WordPress. When you select a component of your site in this editor, you can then modify that section to your liking.

For example, if you click a text box then the editor will provide you with tools and options to change its location, text size, font type, and alignment. 

The **Block Editor** and its options adjust depending on what component you select for ease of use.
