# Explore your homepage

Your WordPress **My Home** page is your hub for quick links, actions, and support. The latest version of WordPress will have its menu on the left side of the screen with several menu items available.

These menu items let you make changes to different parts of your website. Feel free to explore the menu items by:
* Clicking on the menu item directly
* Hovering over the menu item and clicking any expanded items

## Give your site a name

Title your WordPress site before creating your first post or page to get used to the platform and settings.

To change your Site Title:
1. Hover over the **Settings** menu item on the left side of the screen from the **My Home** page
2. Wait for the rest of the **Settings** menu items to appear on the right
3. Click **General**
4. Add your title to the Site Title text box
5. Scroll down and click **Save Changes** to make sure the added text is kept
> NOTE: It is also recommended to complete the tagline text box directly under the title text box to provide your users with context on your site.

This process helps you understand how to navigate the rest of the menu items on the **My Home** page.
