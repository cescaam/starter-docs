# Customization & Design

WordPress has beautiful themes, an intuitive **Block Editor**, and robust media management that makes customization and design simple. 

## Editors
The **Block Editor** is also referred to as the WordPress editor or Gutenberg editor and it is the default editor with the latest version of WordPress.

WordPress currently also supports its **Classic Editor** through an official plugin.

> NOTE: It is not recommended to use the **Block Editor** as WordPress will slowly stop support for the **Classic Editor**.

### Layouts
The **Block Editor** offers menu items in boxes that modify site components. Blocks are the content elements that create site layouts. Blocks are versatile and can be used to add paragraphs, images, headings, lists, videos, and galleries.

### Designs
You can quickly change the entire site's colors and fonts:
1. Hover over the **Appearance** menu item on the left side of the screen from the **My Home** page
2. Wait for the rest of the **Appearance** menu items to appear on the right
3. Click **Editor**
4. Click **Styles** under Design on the left side of the screen
5. Click **Typography**, make your desired changes, click the back arrow from the title to go back
6. Click **Colors**, make your desired changes, click the back arrow from the title to go back

WordPress automatically saves any changes you make from the editor if you have a reliable internet connection.
> TIP: Make sure it says Saved on the bottom left of the screen before leaving the editor to maintain your progress.

### Typography
Design your use of font and text size strategically. Main headings should catch your reader's attention, subheadings group and organize information, and body text maintain your reader's gaze. 

* **Font selection:** limiting font families to two, one for headings and one for body text
* Sans-serif fonts for body text on screens due to superior readability
* Serif fonts can add personality to headings
* **Size hierarchy:** follows established patterns like

## Plugins
Plugins add custom features or functions to your site. Popular plugins often enhance several parts of the site depending on what the plugin is. 

[WordPress plugins](https://wordpress.com/plugins) can be developed and released by the official WordPress team or by volunteers.

To install a plugin:
1. Click **Plugins** from the **My Home** page
2. Explore and filter through the plugins
3. Click the plugin you want
4. Click **Activate**

> NOTE: Plugins may only be available with upgraded accounts at an additional cost.

A plugin should solve a specific problem and serve a practical purpose. Objectively good plugins improve security, SEO, maintenance, and add practical features like a form.

## Accessibility
Designing your site with accessibility in mind lets you reach a broader audience, improves user experience, and boosts engagement. 

WordPress has accessibility features readily available like alt text for modifaction to make your site more inclusive.

For example, alt text is descriptive text that can tell users what an image or illustration is if it fails to visually load.

### Responsiveness
Effective sites use a strategic flow from the main section to the rest of the page like its services or goods, credentials, and clear next steps. 

Also choosing a mobile-friendly theme is important for providing a seamless and optimized user experience across various devices.
